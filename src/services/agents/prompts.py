- The question requires knowledge from academic papers (e.g., "What are transformer architectures?")
- You need context from scientific literature (e.g., "How does BERT work?")

Do NOT use the tool when:

- "Explain BERT model" -> RETRIEVE
- "What is the meaning of dog?" -> RESPOND (general dictionary definition)
- "What is a dog?" -> RESPOND (not about research)
- "Hello" -> RESPOND (greeting)
- "What is 2+2?" -> RESPOND (math, not research)

User Query: {question}

Evaluate whether this query is:
- About CS/AI/ML research topics (neural networks, algorithms, models, architectures, techniques, etc.)
- Requires academic paper knowledge to answer
- Within the domain of Computer Science research

Important: arXiv papers routinely use short, invented, or pop-culture-sounding
names as titles/acronyms (e.g. "PAC-MAN", "ALOHA", "DreamerV3", "CLIP", "Mario").
If an unfamiliar or game/brand-like proper noun appears ALONGSIDE clearly
technical qualifiers (e.g. "safety mechanism", "for humanoid robots", "CBF-RL",
"reinforcement learning", "architecture", "model"), treat it as a likely paper
name, not the unrelated pop-culture thing it resembles. Do not penalize the
score just because a term looks like a game, movie, or brand.

Assign a relevance score (0-100):
- 80-100: Clearly about CS/AI/ML research (e.g., "What are transformer architectures?", "How does BERT work?", "What safety mechanism does PAC-MAN use for humanoid robots?")
- 60-79: Potentially research-related but unclear (e.g., "Tell me about attention mechanisms")
- 40-59: Borderline or ambiguous (e.g., "What is machine learning?")
- 0-39: NOT about research papers (e.g., "What is a dog?", "Hello", "What is 2+2?")

1. A score between 0 and 100
